    "# Document Loaders: Streamlined Data Ingestion\n",
    "There are many document loaders available in LangChain, but we will focus here on a few important ones. The `TextLoader` handles plain text files, `CSVLoader` handles csv files, while the `PyPDFLoader` specializes in PDF files, offering easy access to content and metadata. `SeleniumURLLoader` is designed for loading HTML documents from URLs that require JavaScript rendering. Lastly, the `GoogleDriveLoader` provides seamless integration with Google Drive, allowing for the import of data from Google Docs or folders.\n",

This paper is informed by critical reading of an article. For \\nargumentative articles, the summary identifies, explains, and \\nanalyses the thesis and supporting arguments; for empirica l articles, \\nthe summary identifies, explains, and analyses the research \\nquestions, methods, and findings.  \\nAlthough article summaries are often short and rarely account for a \\nlarge portion of your grade, they are a strong indicator of your \\nreading and writ ing skills. Professors ask you to write article \\nsummaries to help you to develop essential skills in critical reading, \\nsummarizing, and clear, organized writing. Furthermore, an article \\nsummary requires you to read a scholarly article quite closely, which \\nprovides a useful introduction to the conventions of writing in your \\ndiscipline (e.g. Political Studies, Biology, or Anthropology).  \\nCommon Problems in Article Summaries  \\nThe most common problem that students have when writing an \\narticle summary is that the y misunderstand the goal of the \\nassignment. In an article summary, your job is to write about the \\narticle,  not about the actual topic of the article. For example, if you \\nare summarizing Smith’s a rticle about the causes of the B ubonic \\nplague in Europe, your  summary should be about Smith’s article: \\nWhat does she want to find out about the plague? What evidence \\ndoes she use? What is her argument? You are not writing a pa per \\nabout the actual causes of B ubonic plague in Europe.  Further, a s a part of critical r eading, you will often consider your \\nown position on a topic or an argument; it is tempting to include an \\nassessment or opinion about the thesis or findings, but this is not \\nthe goal of an article summary. Rather, you must identify, explain, \\nand analyse the  main point and how it is supported.  \\nRead Carefully and Closely  \\nYour key to success in writing an article summary is your \\nunderstanding of the article; therefore, it is essential to read \\ncarefully and closely. The Academic Skills Centre  offers helpful \\ninstruction on the steps for critical reading: pre -reading, active and \\nanalytical reading, and reflection.  \\nArgumentative Articles  \\n As you read an argumentative article, consider the following \\nquestions:  \\n1. What is the topic?  \\n2. What is the research question? In other words, what is the \\nauthor trying to find out about that topic?  \\n3. What is the thesis or position? What are the supporting \\nargum ents?  \\n4. How are supporting arguments developed? What kind of \\nevidence is used?  \\n5. What is the significance of the author’s thesis? What does it \\nhelp you to understand about the topic?  \\nEmpirical Articles  \\nAs you read an empirical article, consider the following  questions:  \\n1. What is the topic?  \\n2. What is the research question?' metadata={'source': '../../data/WritingArticleSummary.pdf', 'page': 0}\n"
