The spectrum of black body radiation, described by Planck's Law, is continuous and covers a wide range of wavelengths. As the temperature of the black body increases, the peak of the spectrum shifts towards shorter wavelengths, following Wien's Displacement Law, and the overall intensity increases as described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. Black body radiation is crucial for understanding various physical phenomena, including the temperature of stars and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\""

Additionally, DNA provides the basis for individual traits and characteristics, making each person unique.\\n\\nHowever, it is worth noting that not all cells have the same active genes, even though they all contain the same DNA. Different cell types, such as muscle cells, skin cells, or nerve cells, have specific functions, and the required genes for that particular function are activated in those cells.
