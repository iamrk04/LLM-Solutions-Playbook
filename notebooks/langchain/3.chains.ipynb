The spectrum of black body radiation, described by Planck's Law, is continuous and covers a wide range of wavelengths. As the temperature of the black body increases, the peak of the spectrum shifts towards shorter wavelengths, following Wien's Displacement Law, and the overall intensity increases as described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. Black body radiation is crucial for understanding various physical phenomena, including the temperature of stars and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\""

       "'Every cell in our body contains DNA because DNA is the genetic blueprint that carries the instructions for the structure, function, growth, and reproduction of an organism. It is crucial for encoding the proteins and molecules required for cellular processes and maintaining the overall health and function of the organism.\\n\\nIn multicellular organisms like humans, DNA is inherited from both parents and is present in the nucleus of each cell. This genetic material ensures that each cell of the body can perform its specific function, and it also enables the process of cell division, allowing cells to replicate and replace damaged or old cells. Additionally, DNA provides the basis for individual traits and characteristics, making each person unique.\\n\\nHowever, it is worth noting that not all cells have the same active genes, even though they all contain the same DNA. Different cell types, such as muscle cells, skin cells, or nerve cells, have specific functions, and the required genes for that particular function are activated in those cells. This process, called differentiation, allows various cell types to specialize and perform their specific tasks in the body.'"
