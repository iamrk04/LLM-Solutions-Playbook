    "In the context of language models, agents are used to decide the course of action and the sequence of these actions. These actions can either be the utilization of a tool, observing its output, or offering a response to the user. The real potential of agents unfolds when they are utilized appropriately. This explanation aims to simplify the usage of agents via the highest-level API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the practical usage, it's crucial to understand the following terms:\n",
    "1. **Tool**: A function that performs a specific task. It can be a Google Search, a Database lookup, a Python REPL, or other chains. A tool's interface is typically a function that takes a string as an input and returns a string as an output.\n",
    "2. **Language Learning Model**: The language model that powers the agent.\n",
    "3. **Agent**: The agent to use, identified by a string that references a supported agent class. It’s what orchestrates the LLM and the tools. This explanation focuses on using the standard supported agents via the highest-level API. For custom agent implementation, refer to the appropriate documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents in LangChain play a crucial role in the decision-making and execution of tasks based on user input. They evaluate the situation and decide on the appropriate tools to use, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently, most of the agents in LangChain fall into one of these two categories:\n",
    "- **Action Agents**: These agents determine and execute a single action. They are typically used for straightforward tasks.\n",
    "- **Plan-and-Execute Agents**: These agents first devise a plan comprising multiple actions and then execute each action sequentially. They are more suited for complex or long-running tasks as they help maintain focus on long-term objectives.\n",
    "While Action Agents are more traditional and suitable for smaller tasks, Plan-and-Execute Agents help maintain long-term objectives and focus. However, they might lead to more calls and higher latency. Often, it's beneficial to let an Action Agent manage the execution for the Plan-and-Execute agent, thus utilizing both strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a high-level workflow of Action Agents would look something like this:\n",
    "1. The agent receives user input.\n",
    "2. It decides which tool to use (if any) and determines its input.\n",
    "3. The chosen tool is called with the provided input, and an observation (the output of the tool) is recorded.\n",
    "4. The history of the tool, tool input, and observation are relayed back to the agent, which then decides the next step.\n",
    "5. This process is repeated until the agent no longer needs to use a tool, at which point it directly responds to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most critical abstraction to understand is the agent itself. In the context of LangChain, the term \"agents\" pertains to the concept of employing a language model as a reasoning mechanism and linking it with the key element - a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are instrumental in connecting the language model with other sources of data or computation, including search engines, APIs, and other data repositories. Language models can only access the knowledge they've been trained on, which can quickly become obsolete. Therefore, tools are essential as they allow the agent to retrieve and incorporate current data into the prompt as context. Tools can also execute actions (like running code or modifying files) and observe the results, subsequently informing the language model's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, we can abstract two primary modes of operation to consider when employing an LLM: as a content generator and as a reasoning engine.\n",
    "- When used as a \"content generator,\" the language model is asked to create content entirely from its internal knowledge base. This approach can lead to highly creative outputs but can also result in unverified information or 'hallucinations' due to the model's reliance on pre-trained knowledge.\n",
    "- On the other hand, when functioning as a \"reasoning engine,\" the Agent acts more as an information manager rather than a creator. In this mode, it is tasked with gathering relevant, accurate information, often aided by external tools. This involves the LLM drawing from similar resources on a given topic and constructing new content by extracting and summarizing the relevant details."

Through the advancement of AI singularity and breakthroughs in hyperspace technology, cosmic travel had become a common reality. However, there remained a single, impenetrable barrier that eluded even the most determined scholars – the enigmatic Veil, a region of collapsed star systems and black holes that had devoured everything that dared approach it.\n",

Among its starry legions shines the crew of the Kepler – an interstellar exploratory vessel unlike any other, charged with unraveling the mysteries of the celestial unknown.\n",

      "Our saga begins when the enigmatic Dr. Elara Arcturus, a woman both adored and despised for her relentless pursuit of knowledge, unveils her lifelong obsession to her crew: the Celestial Key, an ancient artifact rumored to unlock the Veil and reveal secrets of unparalleled power. Uncertain of the wisdom of such a venture, the crew nevertheless pledges their loyalty, adopting this monumental mission as their own.\n",

      "As they embark on their perilous journey, the Kepler's intrepid crew encounters new civilizations and species, each with something precious – or dangerous – to offer. From the synergistic drone-swarms of the Unc'Khai to the aquatic Naiadus, they form tenuous alliances and navigate the perilous politics of interstellar relations. These newfound allies lead the crew not only closer to their ultimate prize but also deeper into personal growth and self-discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout their odyssey, these dauntless pioneers bear witness to the transcendental beauty of the cosmos and the unfathomable horrors lurking within. Despite numerous setbacks and harrowing moments along the way, they press on, driven by a relentless fire that only the quest for the ultimate truth can fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the climactic final act, the Kepler teeters on the brink of annihilation before the colossal forces guarding the Veil. It is the crew's unyielding spirit and remarkable ingenuity, however, that tips the balance in their courageous favor. Through their incredible camaraderie and resourcefulness, they break past the Veil's invisible barrier and behold what no mortal eyes have ever seen – a primordial construct of colossal proportions and breathtaking beauty: the Celestial Engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humbled by the sight, a greater understanding of their place in the cosmos slowly dawns upon them, along with the disturbing revelation of the unknown machinations that hold the universe in a perpetual dance of creation and destruction. Together, they come to a profound realization: the true power behind the Key and the Veil is not their ability to control the universe, but to understand and appreciate the immutable forces that weave the fabric of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "As our heroes return from their cosmic odyssey, they carry back with them not the power to harness the cosmos, but rather the wisdom to respect its enigmatic intricacies. The knowledge they have gained allows humanity to continue thriving in the ever-expanding reaches of the celestial unknown while preserving the delicate balance that holds the universe together.\n",
