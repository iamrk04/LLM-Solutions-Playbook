# LangChain

Here, you will gain essential skills in expanding the use cases and capabilities of language models in application development using the LangChain framework. You will learn and get experience with the following topics:

- Models, Prompts and Parsers: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
- Memories for LLMs: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
- Chains: creating sequences of operations
- Question Answering over Documents: apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
- Agents: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.

At the end of the course, you will have a model that can serve as a starting point for your own exploration of diffusion models for your applications.

Hands-on examples make each concept easy to understand. Built-in Jupyter notebooks allow you to seamlessly experiment with the code and prompts.
