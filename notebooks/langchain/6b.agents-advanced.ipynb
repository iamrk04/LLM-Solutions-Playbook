    "We will explore the concept of \"Plan and Execute\" LangChain agents and their ability to generate insightful analysis reports based on retrieved documents from Deep Lake. This is the workflow we’ll follow in this project:\n",
    "1. **Saving Documents on Deep Lake**: We will begin by saving documents on Deep Lake, which serves as our knowledge repository. Deep Lake provides information that our agents can leverage for analysis and report generation.\n",
    "2. **Creating a Document Retrieval Tool**: Next, we will develop a tool that enables our agent to retrieve the most relevant documents from Deep Lake based on a given query.\n",
    "3. **Using the Plan and Execute Agent**: The core of our project involves employing a \"Plan and Execute\" agent to devise a plan for answering a specific query about creating an overview of a topic. Our specific objective is to generate a comprehensive outline of recent events related to Artificial Intelligence regulations by governments, but the final agent could also work for other similar objectives as well.\n",

    "#### **Plan and Execute**\n",
    "**Plan and Execute** agents are a new type of agent executor offering a different approach than the traditional agents supported in LangChain. These agents are heavily inspired by the BabyAGI framework and the recent Plan-and-Solve paper. The primary goal of \"Plan and Execute\" agents is to enable more complex long-term planning, even at the cost of making more calls to the language model.\n",
    "- The **planner** in the \"Plan-and-Execute\" framework typically utilizes a language model's reasoning ability to plan out steps and handle ambiguity and edge cases.\n",
    "- The **executor**, initially an Action Agent, takes the planner's high-level objectives (steps) and determines the tools or actions required to accomplish each step."

Find him on Twitter (@Gadget_Ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\\n\\nAdvancements in machine learning and speech recognition technology have made information more accessible to people, particularly those who rely on voice to access information. However, the lack of labelled data for numerous languages poses a significant challenge in developing high-quality machine-learning models.\\n\\nIn response to this problem, the Meta-led Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) project has made remarkable strides in expanding language coverage and improving the performance of speech recognition and synthesis models.\\n\\nBy combining self-supervised learning techniques with a diverse dataset of religious readings, the MMS project has achieved impressive results in growing the ~100 languages supported by existing speech recognition models to over 1,100 languages.\\n\\nBreaking down language barriers\\n\\nTo address the scarcity of labelled data for most languages, the MMS project utilised religious texts, such as the Bible, which have been translated into numerous languages.\\n\\nThese translations provided publicly available audio recordings of people reading the texts, enabling the creation of a dataset comprising readings of the New Testament in over 1,100 languages.\\n\\nBy including unlabeled recordings of other religious readings, the project expanded language coverage to recognise over 4,000 languages.\\n\\nDespite the dataset’s specific domain and predominantly male speakers, the models performed equally well for male and female voices. Meta also says it did not introduce any religious bias.\\n\\nOvercoming challenges through self-supervised learning\\n\\nTraining conventional supervised speech recognition models with just 32 hours of data per language is inadequate.\\n\\nTo overcome this limitation, the MMS project leveraged the benefits of the wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised speech representation learning technique.\\n\\nBy training self-supervised models on approximately 500,000 hours of speech data across 1,400 languages, the project significantly reduced the reliance on labelled data.\\n\\nThe resulting models were then fine-tuned for specific speech tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition and language identification.\\n\\nImpressive results\\n\\nEvaluation of the models trained on the MMS data revealed impressive results. In a comparison with OpenAI’s Whisper, the MMS models exhibited half the word error rate while covering 11 times more languages.\\n\\nFurthermore, the MMS project successfully built text-to-speech systems for over 1,100 languages. Despite the limitation of having relatively few different speakers for many languages, the speech generated by these systems exhibited high quality.\\n\\nWhile the MMS models have shown promising results, it is essential to acknowledge their imperfections. Mistranscriptions or misinterpretations by the speech-to-text model could result in offensive or inaccurate language. The MMS project emphasises collaboration across the AI community to mitigate such risks.\\n\\nYou can read the MMS paper here or find the project on GitHub.\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "Altman highlighted the potential benefits of AI technologies like ChatGPT and Dall-E 2 to help address significant challenges such as climate change and cancer, but he also stressed the need to mitigate the risks associated with increasingly powerful AI models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altman proposed that governments consider implementing licensing and testing requirements for AI models that surpass a certain threshold of capabilities. He highlighted OpenAI’s commitment to safety and extensive testing before releasing any new systems, emphasising the company’s belief that ensuring the safety of AI is crucial.\n",

      "Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal expressed their recognition of the transformative nature of AI and the need to understand its implications for elections, jobs, and security. Blumenthal played an audio introduction using an AI voice cloning software trained on his speeches, demonstrating the potential of the technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blumenthal raised concerns about various risks associated with AI, including deepfakes, weaponised disinformation, discrimination, harassment, and impersonation fraud. He also emphasised the potential displacement of workers in the face of a new industrial revolution driven by AI.\n",

      "The Internal Market Committee and the Civil Liberties Committee of the European Parliament have endorsed new transparency and risk-management rules for artificial intelligence systems known as the AI Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "This marks a major step in the development of AI regulation in Europe, as these are the first-ever rules for AI. The rules aim to ensure that AI systems are safe, transparent, traceable, and non-discriminatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the vote, co-rapporteur Brando Benifei (S&D, Italy) said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are on the verge of putting in place landmark legislation that must resist the challenge of time. It is crucial to build citizens’ trust in the development of AI, to set the European way for dealing with the extraordinary changes that are already happening, as well as to steer the political debate on AI at the global level.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are confident our text balances the protection of fundamental rights with the need to provide legal certainty to businesses and stimulate innovation in Europe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Co-rapporteur Dragos Tudorache (Renew, Romania) added:\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "To boost AI innovation, MEPs added exemptions to these rules for research activities and AI components provided under open-source licenses. The new law also promotes regulatory sandboxes – or controlled environments established by public authorities – to test AI before its deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "MEPs want to boost citizens’ right to file complaints about AI systems and receive explanations of decisions based on high-risk AI systems that significantly impact their rights. MEPs also reformed the role of the EU AI Office, which would be tasked with monitoring how the AI rulebook is implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Wright, Tech and AI Regulatory Partner at London-based law firm Fladgate, commented:\n",
      "\n",
      "“US-based AI developers will likely steal a march on their European competitors given the news that the EU parliamentary committees have green-lit its groundbreaking AI Act, where AI systems will need to be categorised according to their potential for harm from the outset.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US tech approach is typically to experiment first and, once market and product fit is established, to retrofit to other markets and their regulatory framework. This approach fosters innovation whereas EU-based AI developers will need to take note of the new rules and develop systems and processes which may take the edge off their ability to innovate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK is adopting a similar approach to the US, although the proximity of the EU market means that UK-based developers are more likely to fall into step with the EU ruleset from the outset. However, the potential to experiment in a safe space – a regulatory sandbox – may prove very attractive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before negotiations with the Council on the final form of the law can begin, this draft negotiating mandate needs to be endorsed by the whole Parliament, with the vote expected during the 12-15 June session.\n",
