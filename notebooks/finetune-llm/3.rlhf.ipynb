    "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a method that integrates human feedback and reinforcement learning into LLMs, enhancing their alignment with human objectives and improving their efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "RLHF leverages human-curated rankings that act as a signal to the model, directing it to favor specific outputs over others, thereby encouraging the production of more reliable, secure responses that align with human expectations. All of this is done with the help of a reinforcement learning algorithm, namely [PPO](https://openai.com/research/openai-baselines-ppo), that optimizes the underlying LLM model, leveraging the human-curated rankings."

    "RLHF can be useful in guiding LLMs to generate appropriate texts by treating text generation as a reinforcement learning problem. In this approach, the language model serves as the RL agent, the possible language outputs represent the action space, and the reward is based on how well the LLM's response aligns with the context of the application and the user's intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "RLHF must be done on an already pretrained LLM. A language model must be trained in advance on a large corpus of text data collected from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RLHF training process can then be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "- **(Optional) Finetune the LLM by following instructions**: This is an optional step, but some sources recommend fine-tuning raw LLM in advance by following instructions, using a specialized dataset for it. This step should make the following RL finetuning of RLHF converge faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RLHF dataset creation**: The LLM is used to generate a lot of text completions from a set of instructions. For each instruction, we collect multiple completions from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collecting human feedback**: Human labelers then rank the generated completions to the same instruction from best to worst. Humans can be asked to rank the completions, keeping into account several aspects, such as completeness, relevancy, accuracy, toxicity, bias, etc. It’s possible to convert these ranks into scores that we can assign to the text completions in our dataset, where a high score means that the completion is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training a Reward Model**: The RLHF dataset is used to train a reward model, which means a model that, when provided with an instruction and a text completion, assigns a score to the completion. In this context, a high score indicates that the completion is good. The reward model does a very similar job to what human labelers did on the dataset. The reward model is expected to learn, from the RLHF dataset, how to assign scores according to all the aspects taken into account during the labeling process (completeness, relevancy, accuracy, toxicity, bias, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning the Language Model with Reinforcement Learning and the Reward Model**:  Starting from a random instruction, our pretrained LLM generates multiple completions. These completions are then assigned scores by the reward model, and these scores are utilized by a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) to update the parameters of the LLM. This process aims to make the LLM more likely to produce completions with higher scores. To prevent the LLM from forgetting helpful information during fine-tuning, the RLHF fine-tuning process also aims to maintain a small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the fine-tuned LLM and the original LLM. This ensures that the token distribution predicted by it remains relatively consistent. After repeating this process for several iterations, we will have our final, finalized LLM."

    "As seen in the previous lessons, aligning LLM to follow instructions with human values is possible by doing simple SFT (with or without LoRA) with a high-quality dataset (see the LIMA paper). So, what’s the tradeoff between RLHF and SFT?\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, it's still an open question. Empirically, it seems that RLHF can better teach the \"human alignment\" aspects of its dataset if it's sufficiently large and of high quality. However, in contrast, it's more expensive and time-consuming. Reinforcement learning, in this context, is still quite unstable, meaning that the results are very sensitive to the initial model parameters and training hyperparameters. It often falls into local optima, and the loss diverges multiple times, necessitating multiple restarts. This makes it less straightforward than plain SFT with LoRA."

    "Another innovative alternative to RLHF is Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Developed by Anthropic, RLAIF aims to address some of the limitations of RLHF, particularly concerning the subjectivity and scalability of human feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RLAIF, instead of relying on human feedback, an AI Feedback Model is used to provide feedback for training the AI assistant. This Feedback Model is guided by a constitution provided by humans, outlining the essential principles for the model's judgment. This approach allows for a more objective and scalable supervision technique, as it is not dependent on a small pool of human preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RLAIF process begins with the creation of a dataset of ranked preferences generated automatically by the AI Feedback Model. This dataset is then used to train a Reward Model similar to RLHF. The Reward Model serves as the reward signal in a reinforcement learning schema for an LLM.\n",
