The process begins by asking an LLM (ChatGPT) to generate a few search queries based on the text at hand. These queries are then used to search the Internet using Google Search API that captures relevant information on the subject. Lastly, only the most relevant results will be presented as context to the model to suggest better content."

      "Number of pages: 9\n",
      "page_content='You may have heard of simulation theory, the notion that nothing is real and we’re all part of a giant computer program. Let’s assume at least for the length of this blog post that this notion is untrue. Nonetheless, we may be heading for a future in which a substantial portion of what we see, hear, and read is a computer-generated simulation. We always keep it real here at the FTC, but what happens when none of us can tell real from fake?\\n\\nIn a recent blog post, we discussed how the term “AI” can be used as a deceptive selling point for new products and services. Let’s call that the fake AI problem. Today’s topic is the use of AI behind the screen to create or spread deception. Let’s call this the AI fake problem. The latter is a deeper, emerging threat that companies across the digital ecosystem need to address. Now.\\n\\nImage\\n\\nMost of us spend lots of time looking at things on a device. Thanks to AI tools that create “synthetic media” or otherwise generate content, a growing percentage of what we’re looking at is not authentic, and it’s getting more difficult to tell the difference. And just as these AI tools are becoming more advanced, they’re also becoming easier to access and use. Some of these tools may have beneficial uses, but scammers can also use them to cause widespread harm.\\n\\nGenerative AI and synthetic media are colloquial terms used to refer to chatbots developed from large language models and to technology that simulates human activity, such as software that creates deepfake videos and voice clones. Evidence already exists that fraudsters can use these tools to generate realistic but fake content quickly and cheaply, disseminating it to large groups or targeting certain communities or specific individuals. They can use chatbots to generate spear-phishing emails, fake websites, fake posts, fake profiles, and fake consumer reviews, or to help create malware, ransomware, and prompt injection attacks. They can use deepfakes and voice clones to facilitate imposter scams, extortion, and financial fraud. And that’s very much a non-exhaustive list.\\n\\nThe FTC Act’s prohibition on deceptive or unfair conduct can apply if you make, sell, or use a tool that is effectively designed to deceive – even if that’s not its intended or sole purpose. So consider:\\n\\nShould you even be making or selling it? If you develop or offer a synthetic media or generative AI product, consider at the design stage and thereafter the reasonably foreseeable – and often obvious – ways it could be misused for fraud or cause other harm. Then ask yourself whether such risks are high enough that you shouldn’t offer the product at all. It’s become a meme, but here we’ll paraphrase Dr. Ian Malcolm, the Jeff Goldblum character in “Jurassic Park,” who admonished executives for being so preoccupied with whether they could build something that they didn’t stop to think if they should.\\n\\nAre you effectively mitigating the risks? If you decide to make or offer a product like that, take all reasonable precautions before it hits the market. The FTC has sued businesses that disseminated potentially harmful technologies without taking reasonable measures to prevent consumer injury. Merely warning your customers about misuse or telling them to make disclosures is hardly sufficient to deter bad actors. Your deterrence measures should be durable, built-in features and not bug corrections or optional features that third parties can undermine via modification or removal. If your tool is intended to help people, also ask yourself whether it really needs to emulate humans or can be just as effective looking, talking, speaking, or acting like a bot.\\n\\nAre you over-relying on post-release detection? Researchers continue to improve on detection methods for AI-generated videos, images, and audio. Recognizing AI-generated text is more difficult. But these researchers are in an arms race with companies developing the generative AI tools, and the fraudsters using these tools will often have moved on by the time someone detects their fake content. The burden shouldn’t be on consumers, anyway, to figure out if a generative AI tool is being used to scam them.\\n\\nAre you misleading people about what they’re seeing, hearing, or reading? If you’re an advertiser, you might be tempted to employ some of these tools to sell, well, just about anything. Celebrity deepfakes are already common, for example, and have been popping up in ads. We’ve previously warned companies that misleading consumers via doppelgängers, such as fake dating profiles, phony followers, deepfakes, or chatbots, could result – and in fact have resulted – in FTC enforcement actions.\\n\\nWhile the focus of this post is on fraud and deception, these new AI tools carry with them a host of other serious concerns, such as potential harms to children, teens, and other populations at risk when interacting with or subject to these tools. Commission staff is tracking those concerns closely as companies continue to rush these products to market and as human-computer interactions keep taking new and possibly dangerous turns.\\n\\nTags:\\n\\nConsumer Protection\\n\\nBureau of Consumer Protection\\n\\nIdentity Theft\\n\\nImposter\\n\\nJobs\\n\\nOnline Dating\\n\\nPhishing\\n\\nAdvertising and Marketing\\n\\nEndorsements, Influencers, and Reviews\\n\\nOnline Advertising and Marketing\\n\\nAdvertising and Marketing Basics\\n\\nPrivacy and Security\\n\\nData Security\\n\\nTech\\n\\nAdd new comment\\n\\nCAPTCHA    \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n      \\n      This question is for testing whether or not you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions.\\n\\nRead Our Privacy Act Statement\\n\\nIt is your choice whether to submit a comment.

It feels as if AI is seen as something inherently \"bad\" that people are trying to hide as much as possible. I feel like the end goal of this technology\\'s deployment in enterprise sectors is to become invisible to consumers unless explicitly acknowledged.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nMarch 27, 2023\\n\\n\"FTC Act’s prohibition on deceptive or unfair conduct\" Sounds like a violation of the first amendment when the product merely has the capability for deceptive production, as all generative technology can be. I think your agency needs a to lose a nice case before the Supreme Court before the chilling effects from your reactionary department impact technological progress.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nMarch 24, 2023\\n\\nAs usual uncle sam is here with red tape and no actual meaningful solutions. As per the FTC we shouldn\\'t work on progress and forever be remained tied to the status quo because it may be risky. It\\'s come to a point where they are using quotes from freaking Jurassic Park.\\n\\nIt\\'s unbecoming of a Government agency to post/act in this way.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nMarch 27, 2023\\n\\nSo it\\'s ok for the government to be using these tools for intelligence gathering, even when it\\'s arguably unconstitutional and illegal (PRISM), but when this tech is in the hands of corporations and people, the FTC is in a huff about \"consumer safety\".\\n\\nCreate better solutions FTC. Be better.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nMarch 24, 2023\\n\\nI must give, from the absolute most earnest, deepest, bottom of my heart, a very emphatic THANK YOU to the FTC for recognizing what a danger these AI chatbots, image generators, deepfakes, and voice emulators are. AI art programs like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Dall-E, text generators like Chat GPT, and more, are so incredibly dangerous and disruptive to society, and if left unchecked could quite literally cause mass disorder as people use them to impersonate and frame people of things they have not done, or could be used as an excuse to dismiss legitimate charges. These AI programs, by design, are meant to confuse and deceive, and any action that can be taken against them and the companies that propagate them must be taken immediately.\\n\\nSo thank you, FTC, for recognizing the danger these technologies represent, and I hope that we will be seeing some serious investigations into the companies that insist on propagating them for a quick buck, as well as hopefully some serious restrictions on what AI can be used for in the future, and hopefully the dissolution of some of these designed-to-deceive technologies entirely in the future.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nMarch 28, 2023\\n\\nOh yeah, where was you agency when they were putting lead in gasoline? Or the toxic chemical spills happening every month? There are so many mundane things your agency fails at, we don\\'t need you butting in to new stuff.\\n\\nHow about instead of these cringe articles (very surprisingly written by an attorney) you make regulation that can address the underlying issues. For example, to prevent grandma from getting a deepfake call from a grandson asking for money, have phone companies implement a SSL type of solution for identity verification / caller ID.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nMarch 28, 2023\\n\\nThank you FTC. Ignore those people who want to make money off AI in its various forms. Consumers and businesses need and appreciate your help. Please continue!\\n\\nReply\\n\\nApril 05, 2023\\n\\nI received a call from AI solicitation for Social Security.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nApril 27, 2023\\n\\nCool\\n\\nReply\\n\\nMay 03, 2023\\n\\nHuman brain hacking is addictive to robocalling. I am witness robocalling has evolved using deepfakes to produce digital voice/speech doubles that simulate co-workers, friends and family. Over a span of time even emotive is perceived as authentic.  How ML speech technology is exploiting people is not only criminal it is a violation of human rights.
