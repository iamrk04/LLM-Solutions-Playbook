    "# Process Inputs: Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning\n",
    "The strategy of asking the model to reason about a problem in steps is called \"chain of thought reasoning\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important to prevent model from reaching a conclusion too quickly, and to allow it to reason about the problem in steps, thereby allowing it to reach a more accurate conclusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations to consider when using CoT. One limitation is that it has been found to yield performance gains only when used with models of approximately 100 billion parameters or larger; smaller models tend to produce illogical chains of thought, which can lead to worse accuracy than standard prompting. Another limitation is that CoT may not be equally effective for all tasks. It has been shown to be most effective for tasks involving arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning. For other types of tasks, the benefits of using CoT might be less pronounced or even counterproductive.\n",
